# VCO
In this project, I designed and built a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) as part of the Analog Lab course. The circuit is based on operational amplifiers (LM741) and a MOSFET transistor (BS170). Its purpose is to generate an oscillating signal with a frequency that varies according to the control voltage.

The project included an in-depth examination of the relationship between the input voltage and the output frequency, utilizing OrCAD simulations and practical experiments in the laboratory. The results demonstrated a relative alignment between theoretical expectations and real-world testing, showcasing potential applications in more advanced systems.

Key components and design highlights:

Use of operational amplifiers as an integrator and comparator.
Optimization of resistor and capacitor values to ensure stability and accuracy.
Implementation of a MOSFET transistor for switching and control purposes.
Main outcome: The circuit successfully generated an output frequency range of 13.5Hz to 300Hz, corresponding to a control voltage range of 0.5V to 10V.

This description is well-suited for inclusion in a resume to highlight skills in designing, implementing, and practically testing analog circuits.
